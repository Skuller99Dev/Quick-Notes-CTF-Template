# Quick Notes CTF Template

- The purpose of this repository is to streamline note-taking for CTF reports as well as the generation of copy and paste commands. 
- This template helped me to handle the OSCP labs and the OSCP exam, as well as other CTFs.

### Set up :

- Configure 04.- Mix/{machineName} .
- Once the file is configured, all the shortcuts can be accessed with the `/` command.
- They can be called directly by each of the names of the files  **00.-Templates/Folder/name.md**.
